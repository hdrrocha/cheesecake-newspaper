>>Project designed to consume company  API data;

>>I used the following technologies: Retrofit2 for the requests and to simplify the code a bit I used Dagger 2 for dependency injections, SQLit;

>>For each screen and function I created a ViewModel;

>>The project also contains unit testing with mockito.
